**Cafetière** is a server and client tool for remotely managing devices. 
It's an abstraction above common command interfaces such as SSH, and provides
a unified method of performing common functions without having to understand
the underlying platform.

## Origin
**Cafetière** is a re-write of a project written in 2000 for the Java Virtual
Machine. Originally conceived as a next-generation replacement for the 
[Sub7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub7) trojan horse malware, it became
a useful tool for remotely managing servers.

Although SSH mostly removed the need for the project, edge cases continue to 
appear where a remote daemon with improved capabilities over the remote shell
would be useful. As an exercise in networking, dependency management, and 
security, this project has merit. Otherwise, it's just another gratuitous coding 
project.
